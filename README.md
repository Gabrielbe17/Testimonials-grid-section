## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS and 7-1 Architecture
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I tried another SASS challenge, this time was easier but I review basic conecepts of SASS. Having troubles with @use and @forward, so the styles.scss file use @import still... 

### Continued development


- Mixins and Functions
- Mobile first workflow
- Accesibility
- Responsiveness

Those are the techniques I need to keep learning from it and do it properly. Because I found them really useful for every medium/large project.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://sass-lang.com/guide) - This helped me with SASS, it's the official documentation. It's well explained for begginers as me.
